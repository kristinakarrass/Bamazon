# Bamazon

Bamazon is your CLI storefront, which allows customers to make purchases, managers to check/update inventory and executives to see how well departments are doing.

## Bamazon Customer

This part of the app allows customers to see which products are on offer in our store. They can then decide, what quantity of which product they would like to purchase. The customer will receive a message with the amount he was charged and the product he bought. He will then be prompted if he would like to make another purchase.

Should there be insufficient stock of a product, the customer will be alerted, that the product has sold out. He will be prompted if he would like to make another purchase.

## Bamazon Manager

This part of the app lets the store manager check all products for sale, products with low stock, she can add to stock of existing products on inventory, or add new products to the store inventory. The inventory list displays the unique product ID, product name, the department the product is stocked in, its price and how many items are in stock.

### View items for sale

The manager will be prompted to enter a number in order to choose from a list. She will then see all items the store offers, with low stocks displayed in red, sufficient stock in green.
