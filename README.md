Bamazon is your CLI storefront, which allows customers to make purchases, managers to check/update inventory and executives to see how well departments are doing.

# Bamazon Customer

This part of the app allows customers to see which products are on offer in our store. They can then decide, what quantity of which product they would like to purchase. The customer will receive a message with the amount he was charged and the product he bought.
